# PART 1: BUYER OUTREACH (Selling Deals)

Pitching deals to potential buyers - looking for CA execution, calls, offers.

## Top Performing Buyer Campaigns

| Campaign Subject | Responders | Messages | Response Type |
|-----------------|------------|----------|---------------|

| 550 Silver Spur Rd LOI | 4 | 5 | Deal progression |
| Jurupa Valley Properties | 2 | 6 | Engagement + concerns |

---

## Response Classification

### Engaged/Interested (High Value)
Responses that led to calls, CA signing, data room access, or continued negotiation.

**Examples:**
- *"Can we discuss this afternoon?"* - Tim Huynh (Colrich) → led to call + CA
- *"Thanks Jeff. Adding John Yunker who covers Seattle for us."* - Paul Kaseburg (MG Properties) → internal routing
- *"See attached for the executed CA. Talk soon."* - Connor Cope (Mesirow) → deal progression
- *"I may have a property for you. Please call me on my cell."* - Bryan Gordon → reverse opportunity
- *"Nice to meet you -- do you have 15 minutes to catch up today?"* - Kevin Yee → relationship building

### Qualified Passes (Useful Intel)
Responses that passed but provided actionable feedback.

**Example (Tim Huynh - Colrich passing on Seattle):**
```
Thanks for following up yesterday. I think we are going to pass... because it being majority studios.
At $85MM that's $733 per SF. The business plan of operating those sounds challenging as well.
Those short term leases are unique.
Appreciate you giving us a look. Good luck!
```

**Pass Reasons Identified:**
1. **Unit mix concerns** - "majority studios" not attractive
2. **Pricing** - $733/SF seen as high
3. **Operating complexity** - short-term leases challenging
4. **Zoning issues** - "Jurupa Valley can be challenging for W/D uses"

### Forward/Referral
Responses where recipient forwarded to the right person internally.

**Examples:**
- Danny Gabriel → forwarded to Tim Huynh at Colrich
- Paul Kaseburg → added John Yunker (Seattle market lead) at MG Properties
- Alasdair → forwarded to Connor Cope at Mesirow

### Quick Acknowledgments
Short responses indicating receipt/interest to be followed up.

**Examples:**
- "Thanks I got the files. Will dig in."
- "Here you go" (sending signed CA)
- "Yes" / "That works. Talk soon"

## What Worked

### 1. Specific Deal + Urgency Subject Lines
The highest-performing subject line format:
```
Off-Market | [Unit Count]-Unit Class [A/B] | [Submarket] | [Timeline]
```
Example: `Off-Market | 243-Unit Class A | U-District Seattle | Year-End Close`

**Why it works:**
- "Off-Market" creates exclusivity
- Specific details (243-Unit, Class A) filter for serious buyers
- "Year-End Close" adds urgency without being pushy

### 2. Short List / Principal Targeting Language
Opening line pattern that performed well:
```
Reaching out to a short list of principals who can execute on a $75-85M multifamily acquisition before year-end.
```

**Why it works:**
- "Short list" implies exclusivity
- "Principals" signals no-broker-chain deal
- Specific price range + timeline filters

### 3. Bullet Point Deal Structure
Emails with structured deal specs in bullets got better engagement:
```
* 243 units | Built 2023 | Class A
* 95%+ occupied | U-District location
* Seller requires discretion and certainty of close
```

### 4. Soft CTAs with Options
Close that offers choice:
```
If this fits your mandate, I can send the investment summary under CA.
Or if you prefer - happy to discuss first.
```

**Why it works:**
- No pressure
- Two paths to engagement
- "CA" signals serious process

### 5. Quick Response Time
Multi-message threads showed fast responsiveness:
- Same-day replies to inquiries
- Immediate CA delivery when requested
- Proactive follow-ups with data

# PART 2: OWNER OUTREACH (Sourcing Deals)

Reaching out to property owners to source off-market deals for buyers.

## Owner Outreach Campaigns

| Campaign | Responder | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1334 3rd Street Promenade, Santa Monica | Jonathan Barach | *"It would have to be our basis to entertain"* → gave $18.7M basis |
| 6608 Highway 6 N, Houston | Imran Jamal | *"$3.495M, 6.7% cap"* → direct pricing |
| 990 Rayford Rd, Spring TX | Yunus Langha | *"If your buyer is willing to offer $5M 'As-Is' we can sell it"* |
| Mesa Biotech, San Diego | Kirstie Acevedo | *"Happy to engage with you on the below"* |
| 485 Santa Fe, Encinitas | Alex Shah | *"Let me know a good time and I can give you a call"* |
| Institutional Buyer Seeking | Bryan Gordon | *"I may have a property for you"* → reverse opportunity |
| Institutional Buyer Seeking | Kevin Yee | Led to call → NDA request → deal discussion |
| Institutional Buyer Seeking | Will Dyck | *"Always interested in a deal, we would consider selling 3838"* |
| Institutional Buyer Seeking | Ash Pathi | *"Has your buyer toured or reviewed any details of our property?"* |

## What Worked in Owner Outreach

### 1. "Institutional Buyer Seeking" Campaign
Most successful owner outreach - 7 responders, 14 messages.

**Why it worked:**
- Positioned as representing serious capital
- Generic enough to apply to many property types
- Created curiosity about the buyer profile

### 2. Direct Address Subject Lines
```
485 Santa Fe Dr, Encinitas, CA 92024 - acquisition interest
```
Simple, clear, personalized to their property.

### 3. Responses That Gave Pricing Intel
Owners often responded with their expectations:
- *"$5M As-Is"*
- *"$18.7M basis"*
- *"$3.495M, 6.7% cap"*

This is valuable intel even if deal doesn't close.

### 4. Reverse Opportunities
Some owners flipped the script:
- Bryan Gordon: *"I may have a property for you"*
- Will Dyck: *"We would consider selling 3838"*

## What Didn't Work in Owner Outreach

### 1. Low Volume
Only 466 owner emails vs 710 buyer emails. Given similar reply rates, more volume could source more deals.

### 2. No Follow-Up Sequences
Most owner outreach was single-touch. Adding 2-3 follow-ups could improve rates.

---

## What Didn't Work (General)

### 1. Generic Acquisition Interest Subjects
Lower-performing format:
```
[Address] - acquisition interest
```
Examples:
- `485 Santa Fe Dr, Encinitas, CA 92024 - acquisition interest`
- `990 Rayford Rd, Spring, TX 77386 - acquisition interest`

**Why it underperformed:**
- No deal size indicator
- No urgency
- Reads more like a cold inquiry than curated opportunity

### 2. Missing Critical Details
Deals that passed often cited missing info:
- Unit mix not clear ("Is it all studios?")
- Rent roll square footages
- Zoning specifics
- Retail allocation details

### 3. Mismatched Buyer Criteria
Passes happened when:
- Property type didn't match (studios vs. standard multifamily)
- Price/SF too high for value-add buyers
- Operating model too complex
- Location/zoning limitations

### 4. Low Email Volume per Campaign
Many campaigns were single emails to single recipients. Higher volume with proper targeting could improve odds.

## Response Patterns by Recipient Type

| Recipient Type | Response Style | Typical Action |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Acquisition Directors | Quick, action-oriented | Request call, sign CA, ask questions |
| CIOs/Principals | Brief, delegation | Forward to team member |
| Asset Managers | Analytical | Questions about specifics, zoning |
| Owner-operators | Mixed | May offer reverse opportunities |

---

## Recommendations

### Increase Reply Rate
1. **Always include**: unit count, class, price range, timeline in subject
2. **Lead with exclusivity**: "short list of principals"
3. **Structure deal specs**: bullets with key metrics
4. **Offer choice in CTA**: CA or call first
5. **Pre-qualify targeting**: match property type to known buyer mandates

### Improve Conversion
1. **Include unit mix upfront** - prevents studio/standard confusion
2. **Provide pricing context** - $/SF, cap rate range
3. **Address common objections** - operating complexity, zoning
4. **Prepare comprehensive data room** - ready for immediate CA delivery

### Track for Future
1. **Build buyer mandate database** - what each buyer actually wants
2. **Log pass reasons** - pricing, product type, location, timing
3. **Track conversion stages** - reply → call → CA → offer → close

## Campaign Velocity

| Sent Month | Emails | Replies | Rate |
|------------|--------|---------|------|
| Sep 2025 | ~100 | 7 | 7.0% |
| Oct 2025 | ~150 | 3 | 2.0% |
| Nov 2025 | ~400 | 8 | 2.0% |
| Dec 2025 | ~500 | 6 | 1.2% |

Note: September had highest rate likely due to more targeted, smaller campaigns (Institutional Buyer campaign was highly curated).

## Key Takeaways

1. **2% is baseline** - industry standard for cold CRE outreach
2. **Quality > Quantity** - curated lists with matched mandates outperform
3. **Specific > Generic** - detailed subject lines win
4. **Exclusivity works** - "short list" and "off-market" language drives opens
