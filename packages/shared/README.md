# packages/shared

Shared types and constants used by web app and orchestrator.

## What Goes Here
- TypeScript types (Campaign, Prospect, Email, etc.)
- CoStar mapping constants (property types, owner types)
- Shared validation schemas
- Anything both Python and TypeScript need to agree on

## When To Build
When we have two things that need to share definitions.

## For Now
Empty. We'll add stuff as needed.
